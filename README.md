TOP Ruby Programming Linked List


Assignment
You will need two classes:

LinkedList class, which will represent the full list.
Node class, containing a #value method and a link to the #next_node, set both as nil by default.
Build the following methods in your linked list class:

#append adds a new node to the end of the list
#prepend adds a new node to the start of the list
#size returns the total number of nodes in the list
#head returns the first node in the list
#tail returns the last node in the list
#at(index) returns the node at the given index
#pop removes the last element from the list
#contains? returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
#find(data) returns the index of the node containing data, or nil if not found.
#to_s represent your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: ( data ) -> ( data ) -> ( data ) -> nil
### Extra Credit

#insert_at(index) that inserts the node at the given index
#remove_at(index) that removes the node at the given index. (You will need to update the links of your nodes in the list when you remove a node.)
